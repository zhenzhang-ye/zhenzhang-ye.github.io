I am a Postdoc (Research Associate) at <a href='https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/vico/'>Visual Computing Group (VICO)</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hbilen/'>Dr. Hakan Bilen</a> in the University of Edinburgh.

My research interests are applying numerical optimization methods to machine learning or computer vision related problems, e.g., dataset distillation, bilevel optimization, etc.

Before joining VICO, I was a Phd student in the <a href='https://cvg.cit.tum.de/'>Computer Vision Group</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers'>Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers</a> in Technical Univeristy of Munich.
