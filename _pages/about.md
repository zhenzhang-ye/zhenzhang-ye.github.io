I am a Phd student in the <a href='https://cvg.cit.tum.de/'>Computer Vision Group</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://vision.in.tum.de/members/cremers'>Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers</a> in Technical Univeristy of Munich.

My research interests are applying numerical optimization methods to machine learning or computer vision related problems.

I will finish my Ph.D. this summer and am looking for a postdoc. I am happy to have a discussion about it if you think there could be a potential match.
